# FUR-API: Dataset and Baselines for Realistic API Anomaly Detection
FUR-API is an API Anomaly Detection dataset, which aims to simulate realistic API anomaly detection in few-shot and unknown risk scenarios. 
This dataset is presented in the paper: FUR-API: Dataset and Baselines toward Realistic API Anomaly Detection.
More details will be released when the paper is accepted.
